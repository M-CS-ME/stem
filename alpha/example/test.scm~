    (p  All instruction given or received by way of argument proceeds from
        pre-existent knowledge. This becomes evident upon a survey of all the
        species of such instruction. The mathematical sciences and all other
        speculative disciplines are acquired in this way, and so are the two
        forms of dialectical reasoning, syllogistic and inductive. for each of
        these latter make use of old knowledge to impart new, the syllogism
        assuming an audience that accepts its premisses, induction exhibiting
        the universal as implicit in the clearly known particular. Again, the
        persuasion exerted by rhetorical arguments is in principle the same,
        since they use either example, a kind of 
        "<a href='https://www.wikipedia.org'>induction</a>", or enthymeme, a
        form of syllogism.)

    (p The pre-existent knowledge required is of two kinds. In some cases
       admission of the fact must be assumed, in others comprehension of the
       meaning of the term used, and sometimes both assumptions are essential.
       Thus, we assume that every predicate can be either truly affirmed or
       truly denied of any subject, and that 'triangle' means so and so as
       regards 'unit' we have to make the double assumption of the meaning of
       the word and the existence of the thing. The reason is that these 
       several objects are not equally obvious to us. Recognition of a truth 
       may in some cases contain as factors both previous knowledge and also 
       knowledge acquired simultaneously with that recognition-knowledge, this 
       latter, of the particulars actually falling under the universal and 
       therein already virtually known. For example, the student knew 
       beforehand that the angles of every triangle are equal to two right 
       angles but it was only at the actual moment at which he was being led on 
       to recognize this as true in the instance before him that he came to know 
       'this figure inscribed in the semicircle' to be a triangle. For some
       things "(viz. the singulars finally reached which are not predicable of 
       anything else as subject)" are only learnt in this way, i.e. there is
       here no recognition through a middle of a minor term as subject to a
       major. Before he was led on to recognition or before he actually drew a
       conclusion, we should perhaps say that in a manner he knew, in a manner
       not.)
    (blockquote And men go about to wonder at the heights of mountains,
                the mighty waves of the sea, 
                the wide sweep of rivers,
                the circuit of the ocean,
                and the revolutions of the stars.
                But themselves they consider not.)

    (p "If he did not in an unqualified sense of the term know the existence 
of this triangle, how could he know without qualification that its angles were 
equal to two right angles? No: clearly he knows not without qualification but 
only in the sense that he knows universally. If this distinction is not drawn, 
we are faced with the dilemma in the Meno: either a man will learn nothing or 
what he already knows; for we cannot accept the solution which some people 
offer. A man is asked, 'Do you, or do you not, know that every pair is even?' 
He says he does know it. The questioner then produces a particular pair, of 
the existence, and so a fortiori of the evenness, of which he was unaware. The 
solution which some people offer is to assert that they do not know that every 
pair is even, but only that everything which they know to be a pair is even: 
yet what they know to be even is that of which they have demonstrated evenness
, i.e. what they made the subject of their premiss, viz. not merely every 
triangle or number which they know to be such, but any and every number or 
triangle without reservation. For no premiss is ever couched in the form '
every number which you know to be such', or 'every rectilinear figure which 
you know to be such': the predicate is always construed as applicable to any 
and every instance of the thing. On the other hand, I imagine there is nothing 
to prevent a man in one sense knowing what he is learning, in another not 
knowing it. The strange thing would be, not if in some sense he knew what he 
was learning, but if he were to know it in that precise sense and manner in 
which he was learning it.")

    (h3 "Section 2")

    (p "We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a 
thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows
, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause 
of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other 
than it is. Now that scientific knowing is something of this sort is evident-
witness both those who falsely claim it and those who actually possess it, 
since the former merely imagine themselves to be, while the latter are also 
actually, in the condition described. Consequently the proper object of 
unqualified scientific knowledge is something which cannot be other than it is.")
    (p "There may be another manner of knowing as well-that will be discussed 
later. What I now assert is that at all events we do know by demonstration. By 
demonstration I mean a syllogism productive of scientific knowledge, a syllogism
, that is, the grasp of which is eo ipso such knowledge. Assuming then that my 
thesis as to the nature of scientific knowing is correct, the premisses of 
demonstrated knowledge must be true, primary, immediate, better known than and 
prior to the conclusion, which is further related to them as effect to cause. 
Unless these conditions are satisfied, the basic truths will not be 'appropriate
' to the conclusion. Syllogism there may indeed be without these conditions, 
but such syllogism, not being productive of scientific knowledge, will not be 
demonstration. The premisses must be true: for that which is non-existent 
cannot be known-we cannot know, e.g. that the diagonal of a square is 
commensurate with its side. The premisses must be primary and indemonstrable; 
otherwise they will require demonstration in order to be known, since to have 
knowledge, if it be not accidental knowledge, of things which are demonstrable, 
means precisely to have a demonstration of them. The premisses must be the 
causes of the conclusion, better known than it, and prior to it; its causes, 
since we possess scientific knowledge of a thing only when we know its cause; 
prior, in order to be causes; antecedently known, this antecedent knowledge 
being not our mere understanding of the meaning, but knowledge of the fact as 
well. Now 'prior' and 'better known' are ambiguous terms, for there is a 
difference between what is prior and better known in the order of being and 
what is prior and better known to man. I mean that objects nearer to sense are 
prior and better known to man; objects without qualification prior and better 
known are those further from sense. Now the most universal causes are furthest 
from sense and particular causes are nearest to sense, and they are thus 
exactly opposed to one another. In saying that the premisses of demonstrated 
knowledge must be primary, I mean that they must be the 'appropriate' basic 
truths, for I identify primary premiss and basic truth. A 'basic truth' in a 
demonstration is an immediate proposition. An immediate proposition is one 
which has no other proposition prior to it. A proposition is either part of an 
enunciation, i.e. it predicates a single attribute of a single subject. If a 
proposition is dialectical, it assumes either part indifferently; if it is 
demonstrative, it lays down one part to the definite exclusion of the other 
because that part is true. The term 'enunciation' denotes either part of a 
contradiction indifferently. A contradiction is an opposition which of its own 
nature excludes a middle. The part of a contradiction which conjoins a 
predicate with a subject is an affirmation; the part disjoining them is a 
negation. I call an immediate basic truth of syllogism a 'thesis' when, though 
it is not susceptible of proof by the teacher, yet ignorance of it does not 
constitute a total bar to progress on the part of the pupil: one which the 
pupil must know if he is to learn anything whatever is an axiom. I call it an 
axiom because there are such truths and we give them the name of axioms par 
excellence. If a thesis assumes one part or the other of an enunciation, i.e. 
asserts either the existence or the non-existence of a subject, it is a 
hypothesis; if it does not so assert, it is a definition. Definition is a '
thesis' or a 'laying something down', since the arithmetician lays it down that 
to be a unit is to be quantitatively indivisible; but it is not a hypothesis, 
for to define what a unit is is not the same as to affirm its existence. ")
